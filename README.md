# Epharma

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.
Epharma is an e-commerce application to help users to purchase medicines at the comfort of their homes. They can shop for a variety of on-the-counter drugs. If they do require a prescription medication, they would have to upload their prescription on the website and a local pharmacist would take a look at the prescription.
